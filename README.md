Hi there!

I'm a Software engineer specializing in backend development. Fell in love with distributed systems after trying Elixir.

Dabbling with a lot of AI stuff recently. re-learning Rust. I've recently become interested in exploring AI solutions to solve important problems, especially in developer productivity. My goal is to eliminate wasted time and effort, freeing developers for more impactful work. I focus on automating workflows by blending data engineering, software engineering, and AI.
